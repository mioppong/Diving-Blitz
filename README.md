# DIVING BLITZ
This was the first official game I ever made, it was made with Corona SDK, and code written in lua. My boy Adam Brihmi made all the backgrounds in Microsoft paint, and i placed elements around where he drew them. The game was all his idea, I was just the developer.

## Getting Started
* Download files and unzip them
* Download Corona SDK
* In corona sdk, open the folder, which contains the main file


## Running program
* The steps before should allow you to run the game

## Future Work
* In the future, I hope to add more levels, and make the UI cleaner


## Acknowledgments
* Corona SDK
